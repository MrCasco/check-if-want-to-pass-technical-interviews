# check-if-want-to-pass-technical-interviews
 This repo has a collection of leetcode/codesignal/codewars solutions to famous problems frequently asked by FAANG companies, covering the basic topics in technical interviews. 
By studying and doing all these codes I could actually get an Amazon return offer, so I hope I can help you getting that offer too :)

Every code within this repo is made on python.
